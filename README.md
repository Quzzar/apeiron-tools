# Apeiron Tools

## Overview
Apeiron Tools is a specialized collection of calculators designed for accurate and user-friendly computation of time dilation effects in space, particularly in the context of science fiction gaming and storytelling. Unlike conventional time dilation calculators, which often focus on the perspective of an Earth-bound observer, Apeiron Tools uniquely addresses the perspective of moving celestial bodies or individuals traveling at relativistic speeds.

## Features
- **Relativistic Time Dilation Calculator:** Calculate the time dilation experienced by an individual moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.
- **Star Perspective Time Dilation:** Understand time dilation from the perspective of a moving star or celestial body, reversing the common Earth-centric viewpoint.
- **Sci-Fi Gaming Integration:** Tailored for use in sci-fi games where realistic time dilation effects enhance the gameplay experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface, allowing quick calculation without deep understanding of the underlying physics.

## Motivation
The inspiration for Apeiron Tools emerged from the challenges encountered while running a sci-fi game with realistic space-time mechanics. Traditional time dilation calculators are primarily designed from an Earth-centric view, focusing on how we perceive distant stars. However, in a dynamic sci-fi scenario, understanding time dilation from the viewpoint of a traveler moving at near-light speeds is crucial. Apeiron Tools fills this gap, providing an essential resource for accurate space-time calculations in a gaming context.

## How to Use
1. **Select the Calculator:** Choose the calculator based on your specific requirement (e.g., Relativistic Time Dilation).
2. **Input Parameters:** Enter the relevant details.
3. **Calculate:** Click 'Calculate Time' to get the results.
4. **Interpret Results:** The tool will display the time dilation effect from the chosen perspective.

## Example Usage
- **For Gamers:** Calculate how much time has passed for a character traveling at 99.97% the speed of light on a journey to a distant star system.
- **For Educators and Enthusiasts:** Use the tool to demonstrate real-world physics concepts in a classroom or informal learning environment.

## Technical Details
- The calculators use the Lorentz transformation equations to compute time dilation.
- Developed using React.
